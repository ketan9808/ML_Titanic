# Titanic_dataset
This is a short machine learning project in which i have predicted the survival of an individual based on various criteria.
This project is based on a dataset taken from Kaggle in which various parameters are given for an individual and survival based on these parameter i have made a machine learning model.
The processes involved are data treating missing values, feature engineering, binning etc.
and the model i have used for the pediction is RandmForestClassifier ehich gives the accuracy of 80%.
