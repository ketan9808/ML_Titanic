# Titanic Survivor Prediction

Predict the survival of Titanic passengers.

## Getting Started

This is one of the getting started dataset on Kaggle. The aim is to predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on various attributes. For more information about the dataset please visit the competition page [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview). The dataset can be downloaded from the competetion webpage or just click on this link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/3136/download-all). After downloading save the test.csv and train.csv under the "Dataset" folder in the cloned directory. The explanation for the code are given in the code itself in [ML_Titanic_survivor_prediction](ML_Titanic_survivor_prediction) (not completed now) file. If you want comment free version of the same code you can check out the [To be uploaded...]() file and if you want to use kaggle use the link on the [to be uploaded...]() file to open the file directly in google colab.

## prerequisites

To setup this notebook on your system:

- clone the repository on your system.
- download the dataset and place it in "Dataset" folder.
- create a python virtual environment.(optional)
- install required packages using following command

```
